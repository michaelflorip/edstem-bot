Datahub Hub Archetypes
In addition to the non-course-specific hubs like Datahub, R hub, and Julia hub, we have varied hub archetypes which solve unique problems for the instructors.

Course Specific Hubs
EECS Hub
Hub is tailored toward the needs of the EECS instructors who teach courses like EECS 16 A (Designing Information Systems and Devices I) and EECS 16 B (Designing Information Systems and Devices II). Some of the EECS courses run their labs virtually using EECS Hub. One of the interesting use cases involves students using Jupyter notebooks to connect with a serial device. Hub provides additional compute in order to support computationally intensive use cases like remote desktop environments.
Data 100 Hub
Hub is tailored toward the needs of Data 100 (Principles and Techniques of Data Science) instructors. Handles a large scale of around 1000+ students accessing the hub every semester to do their assignments and homework. Hub supports advanced usecases which include students using the PostgreSQL database as part of their assignments and connecting to their USB board from their Jupyter notebooks as part of their labs.
Public Health Hub
Hub caters to the needs of instructors teaching public health-related courses. All instructors use R Studio to facilitate their instructional workflow and a few conduct exams through the hub and use OttR to automate their grading.
Astro Hub
Hub is tailored towards the needs of the astronomy instructor Joshua Bloom who teaches the course "Python for Data Science". Hub has unique python packages installed to satisfy the needs of this course and also provides additional compute to run Astronomy related workflow including large datasets.
Stat 20 Hub
Hub is tailored towards the needs of Stat 20 (Introduction to Probability and Statistics) instructor Andrew Bray.
Data 102 Hub
Hub is tailored toward the needs of Data 102 (Data, Inference, and Decisions) instructors.
Data 8 Hub
Hub is tailored toward the needs of Data 8 (Foundations of Data Science) instructors. Hub handles a huge scale of around 1500+ students accessing the hub every semester to do their assignments and homework. Hub uses a calendar-based scheduler so that all students get the required compute to execute their classroom requirements.
Prob 140 Hub
Hub is tailored towards the needs of Prob 140 (Probability for Data Science) instructors.
Workshop Hubs
D Lab Hub
Hub is tailored to the needs of the D Lab instructors who conduct workshops in R to introduce statistical concepts both introductory and advanced.
Workshop Hub
Hub is tailored toward the needs of the instructors who conduct workshops.
High School Hub
Hub is tailored toward the needs of instructors who teach high school students basic concepts of Data Science.
Mooc based Hub
Data 8x Hub
Hub catering to the needs of the students enrolled in the MOOC Data 8x - Foundations of Data Science hosted at EdX!
