Steps to Set Up Datahub
Image
Step 1 - Create a GitHub repository
Create a public Github repository to upload all your coursework. Files in this Github repository will be used to generate unique links that will be shared with students.
Refer to this documentation to learn about how to use Git and Github.
If you are interested to use the GUI version of Github, Refer to this documentation to learn more about the Github desktop.
If you are interested in adding your repository to the ever-growing collection of modules/connector repositories so that instructors who will be teaching your class in future will thank you then reach out to Balaji Alwar (balajialwar@berkeley.edu).
If you need more support setting up your own repository then reach out to Balaji Alwar (balajialwar@berkeley.edu).

Step 2 - Install nbgitpuller plugin
Nbgitpuller is a wonderful tool that simplifies the assignment distribution pipeline. Unique links generated using this tool will directly take the students to the Jupyter/R Studio based notebooks in Datahub without exposing the complexities of Git.
Install nbgitpuller Chrome or Firefox extension in your respective browser. A good test to verify whether the installation was a success is to access a Github repository (through the installed browser) and check whether you can find the button named "nbgitpuller".

Step 3 - Generate shareable link(s)
Access the notebook for which a shareable link needs to be generated in a Github repository. Click on the nbgitpuller button. Follow the detailed steps outlined in this documentation to generate a shareable link.
