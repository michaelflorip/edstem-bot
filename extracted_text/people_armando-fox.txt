Armando Fox
Faculty Advisor, Online Education
College of Computing, Data Science, and Society
Armando Fox is Professor of Computer Science, Faculty Advisor for Digital Learning Strategy, Campus Equity Advisor, and Computer Science Diversity Officer at UC Berkeley. With colleague David Patterson, he co-designed and co-taught Berkeley’s first Massive Open Online Course on Engineering Software as a Service, offered through edX, through which over 10,000 students in over 120 countries have earned certificates of completion. His current research in online education and education technology includes automatic feedback on students’ computer programs for programming style, helping students learn complex programming patterns using novel assignment formats, and improving engagement and learning outcomes in education at scale, topics on which he has given invited keynotes in both Spanish and English in the U.S., Asia, Spain, and Latin America.
Fox and Patterson’s overhaul of Berkeley’s software engineering course and accompanying award-winning textbook “Engineering Software as a Service,” focusing on agile projects with real customers and heavily guided by modern software practice, influenced the ACM/IEEE Computer Science 2013 Curriculum Guidelines for Software Engineering and was a factor in Fox receiving the ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award. While at Stanford, he also received teaching and mentoring awards from the Associated Students of Stanford University, the Society of Women Engineers, and Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society. His credentials are in electrical engineering (bachelor’s degree from MIT and master’s degree from the University of Illinois), computer science (Ph.D. from UC Berkeley), and piano performance and musicology (Mannes College of Music Preparatory Certificate Program). He is a classically-trained musician and performer, an avid musical theater fan and freelance music director, and multilingual/bicultural Cuban-American New Yorker living in San Francisco.
