Data Science Transfer Mentor & Orientation Program
Beginning the summer before you arrive on campus, Transfer Mentors are available to help as you create your fall schedule, investigate extra-curricular opportunities, plan for internships, and generally guide you as you transition onto campus and into classes by sharing institutional knowledge on diverse topics.
You should receive an email from your Transfer Mentor in early June (make sure to check your @berkeley.edu inbox!).

The Orientation Program: Summer & Fall

Summer Orientation
Over the course of the summer before you arrive on campus, we offer workshops and opportunities to connect with your incoming class of Data Science transfer students.  Workshops are held over zoom and typically address questions about what classes to take, planning your first semester schedule, and preparing for a career in data science.  Events to help you build your community will be held both online and in-person.  Make sure to regularly check your @berkeley.edu inbox for event announcements!

Fall Orientation
During your first fall semester you can choose to enroll in a 1 unit course focused on navigating campus resources, understanding the Data Science major and coursework, building community, and preparing for internships. This course is facilitated by a staff advisor, which allows you weekly access to advising and guidance. Transfer Mentors are very present in the class and often facilitate class sessions on their Berkeley experience and/or resources they’ve found helpful.
