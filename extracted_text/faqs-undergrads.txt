FAQs: Undergraduate Students in Computer Science, Data Science, and Statistics
*Please note this FAQ section will be updated as new information becomes available.
Last updated: March 14, 2024
The College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS) has been established and three undergraduate majors have transferred from the College of Letters & Science (L&S) to CDSS.
These undergraduate programs are:
Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science
Bachelor of Arts in Data Science
Bachelor of Arts in Statistics
The transfer of these programs from L&S into CDSS is fostering a shared student, staff, and faculty community. It also enables better coordination between academic support, advising, co-curricular programs, career advising, and internship placement across CDSS undergraduate majors.
UC Berkeley is in the process of updating student information systems to reflect the transfer. The guiding principles for decision-making include: student experience (easy for students to navigate), equity and inclusion, and using resources to effectively meet student needs.
During this transition period (academic year 2023-2024):
Continue on your intended/declared major pathway as it exists today.
Work with L&S advisors on questions pertaining to college policies and requirements.
Below you will find answers to questions that you may have about the transfer.
FAQs: Undergraduate Students in Computer Science, Data Science, and Statistics
When will CalCentral reflect the transfer of these majors to CDSS?
Students graduating in Spring 2024 in Computer Science, Data Science, and Statistics majors are expected to receive their degrees from the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS). This change is scheduled to take place and be officially reflected in CalCentral in summer 2024.
What does the major transfer mean for students who plan to graduate in Spring 2024?
The inaugural Spring 2024 College of Computing, Data Science, and Society Undergraduate Commencement Ceremony will be held for all three majors on Thursday, May 16, 2024 at the Hearst Greek Theatre in Berkeley at 2:00 pm Pacific Time.
We expect students graduating in Spring 2024 and Summer 2024 to receive their degrees from CDSS. However, these students must continue to satisfy the College of Letters & Science degree requirements for graduation and complete their programs of study as planned.
Computer Science, Data Science, and Statistics students graduating in Spring 2024 and Summer 2024 will automatically receive a degree from CDSS, unless they specifically opted to remain in L&S.
What does the transfer mean for students who are declared in these majors and continuing in Fall 2024?
All students should continue to complete their programs of study as planned.
The transfer to CDSS will be reflected in CalCentral in Summer 2024.
Students will have the option of meeting L&S or CDSS essential skills and breadth requirements. However, CDSS policies (e.g., semester limits, P/NP limits, etc.) will apply.
Where can I get additional information about graduation requirements?
Major requirements: Students should continue to go to their major advisor for all questions about major requirements, which will not change.
College requirements: All L&S College policies and requirements will apply for the academic year 2023-2024. Students should continue to direct all questions about college requirements and policy to the L&S College Advising office.
Forms and Petitions: For the academic year 2023-24, all forms and petitions must be approved by the College of Letters & Science.
The College of Computing, Data Science, and Society plans to open a college advising office in Summer 2024. CDSS policies and requirements are available online in the meantime.
What does the transfer mean for students who intend to declare a CDSS major?
Admitted Before Fall 2023
Students admitted before Fall 2023 who are eligible to declare a CDSS major by the end of Spring 2024 should continue to complete major prerequisites and declare the major via the process listed on the intended major’s website.
Students admitted before Fall 2023 who expect to be eligible to declare a CDSS major in Summer 2024 or later should remain in their current college until eligible to declare. The eligibility requirements will remain the same as the current requirements. More information about the process will be available in Summer 2024.
Fall 2023 Admits
Students admitted in Fall 2023 who selected computer science, data science, or statistics on their admissions application have a guaranteed spot in that major, subject to completing prerequisites and maintaining good academic standing.  Information about filing a major declaration and change of college form will be available in Summer 2024.
Students admitted in Fall 2023 who did not select computer science,  data science, or statistics on their admissions application will need to apply to CDSS if they would like to pursue these majors. Applications will be available during the 2024-25 academic year and will involve a comprehensive review. Transfer admits should also consult with an advisor for their intended major about eligibility to change or add majors.
Admitted Fall 2024 or Later
Students admitted to CDSS in Fall 2024 will be automatically enrolled in their selected major.
Students admitted to another college in Fall 2024 should follow the Change of College or Simultaneous Degree process, to be announced in Summer 2024. Applications will involve a comprehensive review.
Will CDSS College requirements be different from L&S College requirements?
CDSS College requirements are currently under review. Proposed CDSS breadth requirements are the same as L&S breadth requirements, with one exception: a second semester course of a foreign language can count toward International Studies.
Students who graduate in Spring or Summer 2024 must satisfy L&S requirements. A process will be in place in Spring 2024 for continuing students to choose which college’s requirements they wish to satisfy for graduation. All CDSS students entering UC Berkeley in Fall 2024 or later must satisfy CDSS requirements.
Will the College of CDSS offer B.A. or B.S. degrees?
The majors in Computer Science, Data Science, and Statistics are unchanged and will continue to be Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degrees.
What about Simultaneous Degrees (e.g., Data Science in CDSS + Economics in L&S)?
For students already declared in a double major in L&S, their double major will automatically become a simultaneous degree.
After Spring 2024, students who wish to add a CDSS degree as a second major will need to submit a Simultaneous Degree application as part of their major declaration. Applications will be subject to comprehensive review. Updated forms will be available before the application period. Contact the major advisors to discuss eligibility.
What about double majoring within CDSS?
Students who have declared a CDSS major and are interested in declaring a second CDSS major should contact a major advisor in the second program. Some major programs may not allow double majoring.
What about cross-college minors?
The Data Science and Statistics minors are housed in the College of CDSS. The Computer Science minor is administered by the College of Engineering (COE) and will remain in COE.
The Data Science and Statistics minors are available to any UC Berkeley undergraduate student in any college.
Will this affect student access to classes that are restricted to majors-only?
Enrollment restrictions and seat reservations will continue to be managed by each department or program. We do not anticipate any changes as a result of the formation of the new college.
How can my voice be heard?
CDSS has established an Undergraduate Coordinating Committee of nine students and a larger Undergraduate Advisory Board of approximately 60 students. The Coordinating Committee meets monthly with the Associate Dean for Students and Assistant Dean for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Belonging, and Justice to provide input on areas of student concern. The Undergraduate Advisory Board takes on special projects related to student matters. Additional information about these groups and how to get involved will be posted on the CDSS website.
For questions about academic year 2023-24 college regulations, forms and petitions, please contact an L&S college advisor.
