Urban Science
The Urban Science domain emphasis explores the theories and methods used to understand the deep structure of how cities function and the potential of urban policies and planning to shape more equitable futures. Topics include sustainability, mapping, visualization, design, urban economic analysis, smart urbanism, metropolitan structure, urban communities, and place-making, among others.
From the lists shown below, students will select one course from the lower-division, and two courses from the upper-division. The lower division course is a required element of the Domain Emphasis.
Courses in this domain emphasis are often restricted by major to enroll, and several have extensive prerequisites. It may be difficult to complete this emphasis given these restrictions. Students are advised to make appropriate alternate plans.
Prerequisites are shown within square brackets.
