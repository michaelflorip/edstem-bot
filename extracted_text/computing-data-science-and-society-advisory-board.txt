Computing, Data Science, and Society Advisory Board
Members of the Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS) Advisory Board at UC Berkeley include distinguished faculty, alumni, academic visionaries, and technology trailblazers. The board offers guidance on the future of computing, statistics, and information, as well as new disciplines emerging at the boundaries of these disciplines with other fields. The board advises the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society on promising areas of research, the education of data-driven leaders, and the opportunities for computing and data science in technology and society.
The Computing, Data Science, and Society Advisory Board held its first meeting in May 2022.
