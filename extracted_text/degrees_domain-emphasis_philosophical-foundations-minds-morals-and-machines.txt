Philosophical Foundations: Minds, Morals, and Machines
Can machines think? Can they be conscious? Do they have rights? To answer these questions, we need to understand the nature of thought and consciousness is, and the basis of rights. In virtue of what do we count as thinking or conscious? In virtue of what do we have rights? Increasingly, algorithms are replacing human beings as decision makers. When are algorithmic decisions fair? Are we entitled to an explanation of algorithmic decisions? Is it paternalistic or anti-democratic to design algorithms that don’t give you what you want, if that will mislead you or make you unhappy?
