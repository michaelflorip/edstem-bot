UC Berkeley’s Ion Stoica has been named to the National Academy of Engineering, an honor that is among the highest that a professional engineer can receive.
Stoica, a Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences professor and director of the Sky Computing Lab, received this distinction for his work on networked systems for large-scale data processing, analytics and machine learning.
This is the latest recognition for Stoica, who is also an honorary member of the Romanian Academy, an Association for Computing Machinery fellow and a recipient of numerous awards. He co-founded the companies Databricks, Conviva and Anyscale.
Stoica joins more than 2,600 other engineers who have been honored for research, education or practice across business, academia and government. The academy announced its newest class on Feb. 6, which included three Berkeley faculty members.
Members of the academy volunteer to provide insight and guidance to shape federal laws and rules, improve government initiatives, focus the development of new research fields and engage with the public on important issues.
The 2024 class will be inducted into the academy on Sept. 29 at the group’s annual meeting.
