Human Biology
This domain emphasis will no longer be offered after Spring 2022. Any student wishing to declare or change to this domain emphases must submit their declaration or change request to Data Science Advising by Friday of the last week of Spring 2022.
Students interested in this area who will declare after Spring 2022 are encouraged to consider the domain emphasis in Computational Methods in Molecular and Genomic Biology.
From the lists shown below, students will select one course from the lower-division, and two courses from the upper-division. The lower division course is a required element of the Domain Emphasis.
Courses in this domain emphasis are often restricted by major to enroll, and several have extensive prerequisites. It may be difficult to complete this emphasis given these restrictions. Students are advised to make appropriate alternate plans.
Prerequisites are shown within square brackets.
Lower Division (select one)
BIOLOGY 1A. General Biology Lecture (3 units) [Prerequisite: CHEM 1A; Co-requisite: BIOLOGY 1AL]
BIOLOGY 1B. General Biology Lecture and Laboratory (4 units)
Upper Division (select two)
INTEGBI 131. General Human Anatomy (3 units) [BIO 1A, BIO 1B or CHEM 1A]
INTEGBI 132. Survey of Human Physiology (4 units)
INTEGBI 137. Human Endocrinology (4 units) [BIO 1A, BIO 1B]
INTEGBI 140. Biology of Human Reproduction (4 units) [BIO 1A]
INTEGBI 141. Human Genetics (4 units) [BIO 1B]  OR
INTEGBI 164. Human Genetics and Genomics [BIO 1A, BIO 1B, MATH 10A/16A]  OR
MCELLBI 149. The Human Genome (4 units) [MCELLBI 102, MCELLBI 104, or MCELLBI 140]
