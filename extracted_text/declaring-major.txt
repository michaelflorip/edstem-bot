Eligibility to Declare
Prerequisites and Comprehensive Review
When can I apply?
How do I apply?
Eligibility to Declare by Semester of Admission
Prior to Fall 2023
Fall 2023 or Spring 2024
Fall 2024 or Later
For students admitted to UC Berkeley prior to Fall 2023:
All prerequisites to declare must be completed for a letter grade and passed with a 'C-' or higher. (See drop-down below for prerequisites.)
Students must achieve a 2.0 Grade Point Average in Data 8, Linear Algebra, and Data Structures to be eligible to declare. The grades earned in Calculus I & II and Program Structures will not be factored into this GPA requirement.
If a student chooses to take more than one upper-division course toward the major prior to declaring, they must have a minimum 2.0 Grade Point Average in all upper-division courses completed toward the major at the time of declaration.
The Data Science major follows
UC Berkeley policy
on repeating courses; you may repeat a course only if you received a grade of D+, D, D-, F, or no pass (NP), and if you have taken the course only once before. You must repeat the course for a letter grade. Both grades will show on your transcript, but only your most recent grade will be calculated into your GPA for declaration of the major.
P/NP Exceptions
Based on changes to L&S policy, courses completed at UC Berkeley with a grade of Pass in Fall 2022 (due to the UAW strike), Spring 2020, Fall 2020, Spring 2021 and Summer 2021 (due to the Covid-19 instructional disruption) will count toward Data Science major requirements, including prerequisites to declare the major.
For students admitted to UC Berkeley Fall 2023 or Spring 2024:
First-years:
First-year students admitted in Fall 2023 or Spring 2024 who selected Data Science on their admissions application have a guaranteed spot in the major subject to completing the prerequisites (see drop-down below) and maintaining good academic standing.
First-year students admitted in Fall 2023 or Spring 2024 who did not select Data Science on their admissions application may apply to the major via comprehensive review (see drop-down below).
Find answers to frequently asked questions at the official
CDSS FAQ page
and the
Data Science FAQ doc for First-Year Admits
(link is external)
.
Transfers:
Transfer students who were not admitted directly to Data Science can apply
no later than the end of your second semester in attendance
following this criteria:
All prerequisites to declare must be completed for a letter grade and passed with a 'C-' or higher. (See drop-down below for prerequisites.)
Students must achieve a 2.0 Grade Point Average in Data 8, Linear Algebra, and Data Structures to be eligible to declare. The grades earned in Calculus I & II and Program Structures will not be factored into this GPA requirement.
If a student chooses to take more than one upper-division course toward the major prior to declaring, they must have a minimum 2.0 Grade Point Average in all upper-division courses completed toward the major at the time of declaration.

For students admitted to UC Berkeley Fall 2024 or later:
Students admitted to CDSS in Fall 2024 or later will be automatically enrolled in their selected major and do not need to follow declaration procedures outlined on this page.
Students admitted in Fall 2024 or later who
did not
select Data Science on their admission application may apply to the major via comprehensive review (see drop-down below).
Prerequisites and Comprehensive Review

*Data 8, Linear Algebra, and Data Structures must be completed with an average GPA of 2.0 to declare the major.
The Data Science BA accepts Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and A-Level exam credit for the calculus requirements only, per the
UC Berkeley Math department guidelines
. Exam credit is not accepted for the Domain Emphasis or other major requirements.
Comprehensive Review
Not all students declaring will do so through comprehensive review. Please use the "Eligibility to Declare by Semester of Admission" tabs above to determine if this information is relevant to you.
What factors will be considered in the comprehensive review process?
Criteria will include your academic performance as well as your motivation to pursue the Data Science major. We support the University of California policy on the value of diverse viewpoints, including academic and intellectual breadth. If you listed a different field as your primary interest when you applied to UC Berkeley, then you should explain why your interest has changed.
Keep in mind that in a holistic review process no single criterion is of primary importance, nor do you have to be exceptional in every dimension. We urge you not to take on multiple activities in the hope of strengthening your application. Just tell us your background and goals simply and honestly. We will be listening for your own unique voice.
What are the minimum classes required to take before applying to the Data Science major?
Before submitting your application to the Data Science major, you should have completed Data C8 (or Stat 20), and at least 1 additional course in calculus (Math 1A, 16A, 10A or 1B) or program structures (Data/CompSci C88C, CompSci 61A, or Engin 7). Approved transfer courses and/or exam credit may be counted, as outlined on the Data Science website.
Additionally, applicants should be on track to complete the lower-division classes by the end of their 5th semester.
What are the minimum grades to apply for the Data Science major?
There is no minimum grade or GPA required to apply to the Data Science major, and all interested students are encouraged to apply.
If you do not pass a class on the first attempt, you may repeat a class one time for credit toward your UC GPA.
If admitted to the Data Science major, all students must have a minimum C- or better in each course toward the major in order to declare and graduate, and must have a minimum 2.0 GPA overall in the major and in the upper-division courses in the major.
Review additional FAQs about the comprehensive review process.

When can I apply?
Open Application Windows
The application for the Data Science major is open from the 4th week of each term through the week after Finals, including during the Summer.
Please submit your application no earlier than the last 3 weeks of the term in which you will complete your prerequisites.
Major Declaration Form Availability
Spring 2024
: February 5, 2024 - May 24, 2024
First day to apply with prerequisites in progress in Spring 2024: April 22, 2024. Applications will be reviewed after final grades are available, so students should expect a reply in late May or in June.
Summer 2024
: TBD - Due to the impending transfer of majors from L&S to CDSS which will take place during summer 2024, we don't yet know when the summer application will be available.
Deadline to Declare
Students Admitted Prior to Fall 2023
Per L&S policy, declared students adding Data Science as a double major, or changing to the Data Science major, must declare before the first day of their final term in attendance. There is no deadline to declare Data Science as a single major.
Students Admitted to UC Berkeley in Fall 2023 or Spring 2024:
New first-year students admitted in Fall 2023, if not admitted directly in the Data Science major, may apply to declare Data Science when the CDSS comprehensive review process is available.
New transfer students admitted in Fall 2023 or Spring 2024, if not admitted directly in the Data Science major, may change to or add Data Science no later than the end of their second semester in attendance.
Students Admitted to UC Berkeley Fall 2024 or later:
New students admitted in Fall 2024 or later, if not admitted directly in the Data Science major, may apply to declare Data Science when the CDSS comprehensive review process is available.
How do I apply?
Use the "Eligibility to Apply by Semester of Admission" tabs above to determine if you will apply using comprehensive review or prerequisites.
