The Berkeley Data Stack is a collection of open source tools that help enable large-scale data science research and education efforts across UC Berkeley. These tools include:
Jupyter - Interactive computing notebooks
Online Textbooks - Open-source textbooks used in classroom instruction
Interact Links - One-click access to notebook content
Autograding Tools - Ok.py, Nbgrader, and Otter Grader
All of these elements of the Berkeley Data Stack can be found on Berkeley's JupyterHub, known as DataHub. UC Berkeley currently has one of the largest collection of JupyterHub deployments in the world, capable of supporting tens of thousands of users across campus and beyond.
