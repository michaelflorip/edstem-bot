Data Science Minor Available to DeclareFebruary 5, 2020
February 5, 2020UC Berkeley undergraduate students are now able to declare a Minor in Data Science!
The minor is a unique opportunity for Berkeley students across a variety of majors to engage with data science and gain practical knowledge of the methods, techniques, and applications as well as the ability to think critically about the construction and implications of data science.
"The Data Science advising team is really excited to finally be able to declare students in the minor,” said Laura Imai, Advising Director for the Data Science Education Program. “We know a lot of students have been waiting for this. We hope that the minor will make data science more accessible to students across campus in all majors.”
The minor includes two pathways--one via Data 100 for students with backgrounds in linear algebra and calculus, and another via Statistics 131A and 133 that is suitable for those with one semester of calculus.
Students can contact a Peer Advisor in Moffitt Library, email a Data Science Advisor at ds-advising@berkeley.edu, or reference the Division’s website for additional details on the minor.
