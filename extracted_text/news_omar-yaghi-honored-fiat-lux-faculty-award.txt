Omar Yaghi, professor of chemistry and co-director and chief scientist for the Bakar Institute of Digital Materials for the Planet, has received the 2024 Fiat Lux Faculty Award from the Cal Alumni Association as a part of this year's Achievement Awards.
The UC Berkeley community is filled with people pushing the edges of what's possible — business leaders whose achievements have shaped entire industries and benefited humankind; alumni whose dedication to Berkeley has had a profound and lasting impact on students and faculty; and young alumni whose early achievements are already showing great promise for their fields or communities. Each year, the university honors them with the Achievement Awards, co-presented by the UC Berkeley Foundation and the Cal Alumni Association.
The Fiat Lux Faculty Award is given to a faculty member whose extraordinary contributions go above and beyond the call of duty to advance the university's philanthropic mission and transform its research, teaching, and programs. The 2024 recipients will be formally presented with their awards at the Berkeley Charter Gala on Thursday, May 16, 2024. Read more about Yaghi and his research.
