The goal of the domain emphasis in Human and Population Health is to expose students to questions, data structures, and methodology related to research in subject-matter areas such as epidemiology, environmental health, nutrition, toxicology, metabolic diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer.  This includes the formulation of meaningful research questions, the development of sound study designs, data collection, exploratory data analysis, the application of pertinent statistical and computational methods, and the interpretation and validation of results.
From the lists shown below, students will select one course from the lower-division, and two courses from the upper-division. The lower division course is a required element of the Domain Emphasis.
Courses in this domain emphasis are often restricted by major to enroll during Fall or Spring semesters. It may be difficult to complete this emphasis given these restrictions. Some of the courses (in Public Health particularly) may be offered during Summer without these enrollment restrictions. Students are advised to make appropriate alternate plans.
Prerequisites shown within square brackets.
