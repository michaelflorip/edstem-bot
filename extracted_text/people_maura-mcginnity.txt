Maura McGinnity
Senior Assistant Dean, Development
College of Computing, Data Science, and Society
Maura McGinnity leads development and external relations at the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS) and is responsible for engaging donors with outreach and relationship strategies in support of its innovative vision. In her role, McGinnity sets the strategic direction for the CDSS development team, supports the CDSS advisory board, and partners with college leaders on interdisciplinary programs and initiatives.
McGinnity joined CDSS in February 2023 from Stanford University, where she served as senior director of development for the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research. In close partnership with faculty, colleagues, and donors, McGinnity developed and collaborated on engagement strategies that led to transformative gifts in support of several university interdisciplinary institutes and endeavors, including the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute; Sarafan ChEM-H (Chemistry, Engineering, and Medicine for Human Health); the Sapp Center for Science Teaching and Learning; the Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance; Stanford Bio-X; the Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience; and Stanford HAI (Human-centered Artificial Intelligence).
While at Stanford, McGinnity also significantly increased endowment support for the Stanford Bio-X seed grant and fellowship programs and three consortium funds that accelerate pioneering ideas, cross-disciplinary research, and team science. She previously served as director of Stanford’s university major gifts team for California, providing strategic leadership coaching for seven staff members focused on building relationships with alumni, parents and friends. She has more than 25 years of development, strategy, and marketing experience in academia and industry and holds a master’s degree in business administration from Simon School of Business at the University of Rochester. She serves on advisory boards for the Strategic Initiatives Group for Advancement Professionals, Whitman College Athletics, LeaderXpress and Palo Alto Partners in Education.
