Evolution and Biodiversity
The domain emphasis in Evolution and Biodiversity explores the origins and evolution of the astounding diversity of life on earth. Topics include the analyses and understanding of diverse data from fossils to genomes from our deep past to better understand our planet today.
From the lists shown below, students will select one course from the lower-division, and two courses from the upper-division. The lower division course is a required element of the Domain Emphasis.
Prerequisites are shown within square brackets.
Lower Division (select one)
BIOLOGY 1A. General Biology Lecture (3 units) [Prerequisite: CHEM 1A; Co-requisite: BIOLOGY 1AL]
BIOLOGY 1B. General Biology Lecture and Laboratory (4 units)
Upper Division (select two)
ESPM/INTEGBI C105. Natural History Museums and Biodiversity Science (3 units)
ESPM 108B. Environmental Change Genetics (3 units) [Prerequisites: BIO 1A]
