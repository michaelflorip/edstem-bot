Program Planning
We are happy to provide sample program plans and other resources to help students plan their classes. However, everyone's plan will be different, so please consult with a Data Science Advisor for help creating the perfect plan for you! Also, keep in mind that your plan is likely to change over time as you learn more about new classes, new opportunities and about yourself. Some helpful resources:
Sample 2-year and 4-year program plans
Data Science BA Worksheet [PDF]
Blank Long-Term Program Plan [PDF]

Information for Prospective Transfer Students
Our students come from all sorts of backgrounds and interests, with very diverse career pursuits.  Some of our students are in research, others spend their summers in internships. The Data Science major is very flexible and allows students to create a curriculum that best fits their educational goals. See more for prospective transfers students here.
Transfer Mentor & Orientation Program
Beginning the summer before you arrive on campus, Transfer Mentors are available to help as you create your fall schedule, investigate extra-curricular opportunities, plan for internships, and generally guide you as you transition onto campus and into classes by sharing institutional knowledge on diverse topics. Learn more about Data Science Transfer Mentors.
