Data Science Major/Minor
The Data Science Major at Berkeley incorporates technical foundations and the study of human contexts and ethics, along with more than two dozen domain emphases, or areas of application. The new Data Science Minor features a flexible design to serve students from a range of majors.
Human Contexts and Ethics Program
The Human Contexts and Ethics (HCE) program is a community of students and faculty examining the dynamics of technology development and social values in a datafied world. The Data 104 class is a very popular upper division class that is taken by most students in the major and minor.  The HCE Toolkit is an open set of tools for teaching and investigating in a variety of classes.

Curriculum Guide
The information in the guide is primarily intended for instructors who either currently are or will be teaching a course in the UC Berkeley Data Science Education Program: either a connector course, a data-enabled course, or a course featuring a data science module. However, anyone else who wants to learn more about the program, the courses, and the technology is encouraged to look through the guide.
