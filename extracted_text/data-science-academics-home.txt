Why Study Data Science?
The Data Science curriculum, designed in collaboration with faculty from across the University, invests students with deep technical knowledge, expertise in how to apply that knowledge in a field of their choosing, and an understanding of the social and human contexts and ethical implications of how data are collected, analyzed and used. This combination positions graduates to help inform and develop solutions to a range of pressing challenges, from adapting industry to a new world of data, to amplifying learning in education, to helping communities recover from disaster.
Data Science Major
Offered by the College of Letters & Science
The Data Science Major equips students to draw sound conclusions from data in context, using knowledge of statistical inference, computational processes, data management strategies, domain knowledge, and theory. Students will learn to carry out analyses of data through the full cycle of the investigative process in scientific and practical contexts. Students will gain an understanding of the human and ethical implications of data analytics and integrate that knowledge in designing and carrying out their work. Learn more...
Data Science Minor
Offered by the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society
The Minor in Data Science at UC Berkeley aims to provide students with practical knowledge of the methods and techniques of data analysis, as well as the ability to think critically about the construction and implications of data analysis and models. The minor will empower students across the wide array of campus disciplines with a working knowledge of statistics, probability, and computation that allow students not just to participate in data science projects, but to design and carry out rigorous computational and inferential analysis for their field of interest.
