Workshops
There are 2 ways to meet with a Data Science Advisor:
Book an appointment, up to 7 days in advance.
Come to our virtual online drop-in advising hours, no appointment required.
You can also meet with a Data Science Peer Advisor for advice from a fellow student.
Advising Appointments
Current students may schedule a 30-minute advising appointment with a Data Science Major Advisor.
Advising appointments become available each weekday, up to 1 week in advance. If you don't see any appointments available, please try again the following day or come to our virtual drop-in advising hours instead (schedule below).
Book Virtual

You will not be able to sign in if drop-in hours have not started or have already ended. Sign-ins may end early if the waiting list is already too long for advisors to see all waiting students.
