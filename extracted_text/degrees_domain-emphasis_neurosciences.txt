Neurosciences
The Neuroscience domain emphasis provides students with expertise in models and methods of computational neuroscience, including data analysis and theoretical models of information processing in the brain. Students with this emphasis will be able to apply statistical analyses to extract patterns embedded in high-dimensional neuroscience datasets (multi-unit recordings, optical imaging, EEG, fMRI), and develop computational models toward elucidating neural mechanisms of information processing in the brain.
From the lists shown below, students will select one course from the lower-division, and two courses from the upper-division. The lower division course is a required element of the Domain Emphasis.
Prerequisites shown within square brackets.
Lower Division (select one)
MCELLBI/PSYCH C61. Brain, Mind, and Behavior (3 units)
MCELLBI/PSYCH C64. Exploring the Brain: Introduction to Neuroscience (3 units)
Upper Division (select two)
ANTHRO 107. Evolution of the Human Brain [ANTHRO 1]
COGSCI C127. Cognitive Neuroscience - [MCELLBI C61, COG SCI C100]
INTEGBI 139. The Neurobiology of Stress [BIO 1A]
MCELLBI 160. Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology (4 units) [BIO 1A+1AL, PHYSICS 8B]
MCELLBI 161. Circuit, Systems, and Behavioral Neuroscience (4 units) [MCELLBI 160]
MCELLBI 165. Neurobiology of Disease (3 units) [MCELLBI 160]
MCELLBI 166. Biophysical Neurobiology (3 units) [BIO 1A+1AL, CHEM 3B, PHYSICS 8B]
PSYCH C113/INTEGBI C143A. Biological Clocks: Physiology and Behavior (3 units) [MCELLBI 160]
PSYCH 117. Human Neuropsychology (3 units) [MCB/PSYCH C61]
PSYCH 125. The Developing Brain (3 units) [MCB/PSYCH C61 recommended]
These course lists are subject to change.
