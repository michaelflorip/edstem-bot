Physical Science Analytics
The Physical Science Analytics domain emphasis allows students to explore ways that data analytics, inference, computational simulation and modeling, uncertainty analysis, and prediction arise in physical science and engineering domains.
From the lists shown below, students will select one course from the lower-division, and two courses from the upper-division. The lower division course is a required element of the Domain Emphasis.
Courses in this domain emphasis are often restricted by major to enroll, and several have extensive prerequisites. It may be difficult to complete this emphasis given these restrictions. Students are advised to make appropriate alternate plans.
Prerequisites are shown within square brackets.
Lower Division (select one)
PHYSICS 5BL. Introduction to Experimental Physics I (2 units) [Prerequisites: PHYSICS 5A or 7A; 5B or 7B]
and PHYSICS 5CL. Introduction to Experimental Physics II (2 units) [Prerequisites: PHYSICS 5B & 5BL or 7B; 5C or 7C]
