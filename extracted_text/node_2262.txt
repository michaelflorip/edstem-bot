Graduate Education
Computational Biology
Ph.D. in Computational Biology
The main objective of the Computational Biology Ph.D. is to train the next generation of scientists who are passionate about exploring the interface of computation and biology and committed to functioning at a high level in both computational and biological fields.
Designated Emphasis in Computational and Genomic Biology
The Designated Emphasis is a specialization offered adjunct to affiliated doctoral degrees for students with research interests in computational biology and genomics. DE students receive a solid foundation in the different facets of computational/genomic research and the ensuing competitive edge for the most desirable jobs in academia and industry, which increasingly require interdisciplinary training.
Computational Precision Health
Ph.D. in Computational Precision Health
Students in the Ph.D. in Computational Precision Health develop skills and expertise in both the computational sciences (machine learning and AI, natural language processing, statistical inference and modeling, data standards, parallel computing and data at scale, etc.) and health sciences (clinical decision sciences and cognitive informatics, clinical delivery, clinical research, implementation science, health information policy, etc.).
Designated Emphasis in Computational Precision Health
Current UCSF and UC Berkeley PhD students from affiliated programs can incorporate CPH courses and advising into their Ph.D. Designated Emphasis students will receive a solid grounding in the fundamentals of computational precision health, with training in the application of computation to the practice of medicine and public health.
Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences
Master of Engineering (M.Eng.)
The Master of Engineering program offers innovative graduate courses on scientific and technical topics, organized by technical concentrations that match student interest.
Master of Science (M.S.) and PhD in Electrical Engineering or Computer Science
The Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) programs emphasize research preparation and experience.
Joint Bachelors/Masters (5th Year M.S.)
This program is available only to Berkeley EECS and CS L&S Undergraduates. It is a five year combined Bachelor/Master's program geared toward outstanding and highly motivated students who desire a program of study that offers greater breadth than is practical in the B.S. or B.A. programs alone.
Statistics
Master of Arts (M.A.) in Statistics
Professional master's program candidates are engaged in a full-time program for one year (with a possibility of a third semester depending on circumstances). The program is designed to prepare students for careers in industries that require statistical skills.
Ph.D. in Statistics
The Statistics Ph.D. program welcomes students from a broad range of theoretical, applied, and interdisciplinary backgrounds, and provides rigorous preparation for a future career in statistics, probability, or data science. Students in the Ph.D. program take core courses on the theory and application of probability and statistics during their first year.
Designated Emphasis in Computational and Data Science and Engineering
The College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS) sponsors a Designated Emphasis in Computational and Data Science and Engineering, a program committed to the development of new curricula and expanded programs aimed at the development and use of numerical and computational tools to further research across multiple disciplines.
