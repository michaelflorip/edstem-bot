Academic Enrichment for Data Science Students
UC Berkeley has pioneered an innovative undergraduate curriculum that takes allows students from a variety of fields to use data-driven methods to think critically about the world, draw conclusions from data, and effectively communicate results. Key elements include:
Data Science & AI Discovery
The Data Science Discovery Program incubates and accelerates data science and AI projects with academic researchers, government agencies, non-profits, and industry partners across the world. Undergraduate and graduate student participants receive project management, technical consulting, and cloud computing support from the Data Science Discovery Consultants. The Discovery Program is a joint initiative of the Berkeley Institute of Data Science, Data Science Undergraduate Studies, and D-Lab.
Data Science Course Staff
The College of Computing, Data Science, and Society appoints graduate and undergraduate students to support its instructional programs. Our outstanding staff teams bear significant responsibility for our students’ experience and learning in Data classes. Staff team members also form strong bonds with each other, mentor junior members, and create staff networks for academic and professional development.
Berkeley Unboxing Data Science (BUDS)
Berkeley Unboxing Data Science (BUDS) is a Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS) summer program that immerses high school students in the world of data science and research.
Data Scholars
The Data Scholars Program provides spaces where students from many disciplines and backgrounds learn together, develop their data science skills, and co-create a diverse community.  Students receive mentorship, support in introductory data science classes, and guidance to advance in the field through academic support, research opportunities, professional development, and community with other Scholars.
Data Science Career Accelerator
Looking for your first internship or job can be intimidating and stressful - even when things are going well! Securing employment takes hard work, and DSUS is committed to helping you navigate this process successfully. To support you in your career goals, we provide Career Services and the Career Accelerator Program (CAP).
Student Teams
The Data Science Undergraduate Studies student teams allow students to engage with university staff and faculty to help develop cutting-edge and multidisciplinary data science curriculum. Connecting computing, statistics, and the humanities, our student teams reach throughout campus and welcome students from all backgrounds to contribute to the success of our education program.
Our student teams and interns are instrumental in driving the efforts of the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society forward. Our students function as researchers, curriculum developers, and ambassadors for data science throughout campus — they are the heart of our program!

Program Support Teams
Connector Course Assistants - Teach Data Science: Connector Assistants work with faculty and staff to support the Data 8 connector courses in a wide variety of disciplines. Connector courses weave together core concepts and approaches from Data 8 with complementary ideas or areas from other relevant fields. Along the way, students gain additional experience, broader insights, or deeper theoretical or computational foundations.
Human Contexts and Ethics - Ethical Data: The Human Contexts and Ethics team (HCE) is a passionate team that is dedicated to integrating critical thinking surrounding questions of ethics in technology into the Berkeley Data Science curriculum and community. Some of their work includes case study and dataset development for teaching and collaborative outreach on campus and online.
Data Science Modules - Develop Curriculum: The Modules team develops Jupyter notebooks for courses in a variety of departments throughout campus. Modules are short explorations into data science that give students the opportunity to work hands-on with a dataset relevant to their course or discipline and receive some instruction on the principles of data analysis, statistics, and computing.
Online Learning Services - Support Data 8X: The Online Learning Services (OLS) team primarily helps support the operations of Berkeley's online edX course, Data 8X, and develops new content on a variety of platforms. Students on the OLS team contribute to implementing a large-scale data science education initiative in collaboration with industry professionals, extending their reach into the wider technology community.
Data Peer Consulting - Data Science Support: Data Peer Consultants help make data science accessible across the broader campus community. They provide their data science expertise to students who need technical help with their research, personal projects, course work, or assignments. They also collaborate with the UC Berkeley Library, D-Lab, and Research IT on data literacy and data science technical workshops.
Data Science Peer Advising - Major/Minor Advising: Peer Advisors complement the Data Science Advising services by sharing their diverse knowledge of and experiences with major and minor courses, different Data Science Major domain emphases, extracurriculars and student groups on campus, research opportunities, and various campus resources. They also host events such as Course Enrollment Night! Also included are the Transfer Mentors, whose primary responsibility is outreach over the summer to incoming Data Science-intended transfer students
Global Adoption Team - Global Data Science: The Global Adoption team works primarily to help grow a community of practice in data science pedagogy and infrastructure around the world, creating a national community of practice for institutions all over. The Global Adoption team helps the Data Science Undergraduate Studies with hosting institutions and professors from around the world during their annual Data Science Education workshop.
Infrastructure Team - Develop Software: The Infrastructure team develops and maintains infrastructure and autograding programs for widespread external use. Students in this team are at the exciting intersection between software development and data science education. Infrastructure developed by this team is used by tens of thousands of students online.
Discovery Operations - Research Support: The Discovery Operations team supports the Discovery Research Program — one of the largest research programs on campus. Students on this team are able to assist in workshop development and interface and check in with student researchers to gauge the overall health and progress of the program. This team is vital to maintaining a well-functioning and effective data science research program.
Human Resources and Management - Internal Projects: The Human Resources and Management Interns work closely with faculty and staff in the Data Science Undergraduate Studies student teams to ensure success within the program. Students have the opportunity to help facilitate inter-program communication and collaboration, interact with the student projects within all Data Science student
teams, and provide assistance throughout the semester.
Communications Team - Marketing & Outreach: The Communications team is a small team of skilled students who focus on highlighting the projects and initiatives within the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society both on- and off-campus. The Communications team helps manage online webpages and promotional materials for the Division and student teams, and has helped promote data science at events such as CalDay and the end-of-semester Data Science Showcase.
Strategic Operations/Nexus - Assist Programs: The Strategic Operations team works closely with faculty, staff, and all of our student teams to develop short- and long-term tasks and goals. The Strategic Operations team is critical in planning events for the Data Science Undergraduate Studies student teams, and processing financial records for staff, faculty, and vendors. Students on this team also often assist with special projects and operations within the Data Science student teams as needed.
