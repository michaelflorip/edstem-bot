Frequently Asked Questions
Updated March 31, 2022
Will these positions be remote or in-person?
Positions will vary from remote to in-person depending on the team. Please contact us at ds-teams@berkeley.edu(link sends email) for more specific inquiries.
I will be located out-of-state or out-of-country for the spring semester. Am I still able to apply?
If you will be located outside of California:
You can still apply! If you receive an offer with us and decide to accept, you must agree to follow all of our policies in compliance with campus around reporting out-of-state work or your out-of-state address on all necessary platforms (i.e., CalCentral) for tax implications. You must also fill out an out-of-state work agreement via Docusign, which you will be provided during onboarding.
If you will be located outside of the U.S.:
The University of California as an employer does not yet have systems in place to ensure compliance requirements are met; therefore, the UC expects paid employees to conduct work within the United States at this time.
BUT, we are recruiting for a few roles on a volunteer basis, and these roles are open to students outside of the U.S.
Are any research positions available for the summer?
The College of Computing, Data Science, and Society has a program focused on research called the Discovery Research Program. Please check their website for the most up-to-date information and deadlines.
The College also has a pilot program called Discovery Exchange, which links students together for independent data science research. Learn more about the program at the Discovery Exchange website.
Where can I find more information about a team or specific position?
You can find information about all of our teams on our Student Opportunities page. You may also find it helpful to review the Data Science Undergraduate Studies' Student Teams Structure Chart (link is external) before applying. More information about specific positions, job descriptions, responsibilities, and qualifications for each position are posted below.
Are there any work-study positions available?
Yes — all paid positions are eligible for work-study, and there is no separate application for work-study applicants. If you receive an offer with us in a paid role and decide to accept, we will contact you about whether you want to use work-study (you must be eligible) for this role. If you choose to use your work-study, we will send you an offer through the Work-Study Management System, which you must accept promptly so that your work-study can be processed in time.
