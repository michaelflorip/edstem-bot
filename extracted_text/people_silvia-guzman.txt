Silvia Guzman
Undergraduate Major Advisor
Data Science Undergraduate Studies
Silvia Guzman is from the Central Valley, born and raised.  She studied history and earned my B.A. in History and minor in International Studies from the University of the Pacific in Stockton, CA. She is an advocate for increasing college access and resources to students. While her role may be to advise on Data Science Major and Minor requirements, she loves to talk with students about their personal growth and academic development during their time at Cal, pointing them to resources and opportunities they may not be aware of. A wise mentor of mine once said, "It is ok if your path is non-linear". We often become too consumed with what the ideal, typical path is that we forget to take opportunities and risks that can lead us to accomplish great things or that actually serve us better. She can spend hours talking about travel and the beauty of experiencing different cultures, so be careful about asking me what my favorite travel destinations are... It might turn into a long conversation.
