Policies
To satisfy the requirements of the major, all courses must be taken for a letter grade and passed with a 'C-' or higher.
Students must maintain a 'C' average in courses taken for the major, and in the upper-division courses taken for the major.
A minimum 2.0 overall Grade Point Average is required to remain in good standing.
See details about each of the upper-division requirements and the lists of courses that satisfy each in the drop-down menus below.
Requirements: Upper-division
The Data Science B.A. degree is offered by the College of Letters & Science, and students must also plan to meet all L&S College requirements in order to graduate.
The Data Science major requires a minimum of 8 upper-division courses, totaling a minimum of 28 upper-division units, effective Fall 2019. Along with Computational and Inferential Depth, Probability, Modeling, Machine Learning, Decision Making, and Human Contexts and Ethics (all detailed below), students will also select and complete a Domain Emphasis. Learn more about the Domain Emphasis requirement here.
A single course may not be used to fulfill more than one requirement within the requirements of the major.
Data Science BA Worksheet [PDF]

Acceptable courses:
Data 100. Principles and Techniques of Data Science (4 units)
Substitution option (valid through Fall 2018 only):
STAT 133 (3 units) + STAT 135 (4 units) + CS 61A (4 units)
Probability
A student will be required to take one course in probability. An understanding of probability is essential for dealing with uncertainty and randomness, the algebraic properties of estimation, the ability to formulate and comprehend stochastic simulations, and many other aspects of data science theory and practice.
Acceptable courses:
DATA / STAT C140. Probability for Data Science (4 units)
EECS 126. Probability and Random Processes (4 units) [formerly EL ENG 126]

Probability is a prerequisite to most, if not all, of the approved courses to meet the Modeling, Learning, & Decision-Making requirement, so all students should plan to complete Probability at least 1 full semester before their expected graduation term, not including summers.
**Students may only count ONE of these three courses towards the major: IND ENG 173 or STAT 150 (from C&ID), or EECS 126 (from Probability).
Computational & Inferential Depth
A student will be required to take two courses comprising 7 or more units from a list of advanced courses providing computational and inferential depth (C&ID) beyond that provided in Data 100 and the lower division (see below).
It is recognized that, currently, some of these courses have prerequisites that are not formally within the major, so for some combinations  students may need to use electives to complete those. However, many options are available that do not place such demands.

Human Contexts and Ethics
Students will be required to take one course from a curated list of courses that establish a human, social, and ethical context in which data analytics and computational inference play a central role. The purpose of this requirement is to equip the student with an understanding of the human and social structures, formations, and practices that shape data science activity (such as data collection and analysis, data stewardship and governance, work to ensure privacy and security, deployment of data in societal or organizational settings, decision-making with data, engagements of data with justice, practices of data ethics) and to allow them to gain experience and practice with modes of critical thinking, reflection, and engagement with these experiences and the choices involved.

Domain Emphasis
Domain Emphases give students a grounded understanding of a particular domain of data-intensive research, relevant theory, or an integrative intellectual thread. A Domain Emphasis is comprised of three courses chosen from a list. Each Domain Emphasis is rooted in a lower division course, which is typically also a prerequisite for the upper division courses.
See the full list of available Domain Emphasis options.
If needed to reach the minimum 28 upper-division units required for the major, choose an additional course from one of the following categories: Computational & Inferential Depth, Human Contexts & Ethics, or your selected Domain Emphasis.
Approved Exceptions/Substitutions
P/NP Grading Exceptions:
Based on changes authorized by L&S policy, courses completed at UC Berkeley with a grade of Pass in FALL 2022 will count toward Data Science major requirements, including prerequisites to declare the major. See the L&S Fall 2022 Late Grading Option Change Modification for more information.
Based on changes authorized by L&S policy, courses completed at UC Berkeley with a grade of Pass in Spring 2020, Fall 2020, Spring 2021 and Summer 2021 will count toward Data Science major requirements, including prerequisites to declare the major. Please see the L&S P/NP policy modifications for more information.
Prerequisite courses taken on a P/NP basis before Fall 2018 will be accepted. Grades of ‘P’ earned will be evaluated as ‘C-’ for GPA calculation purposes. Courses taken on a P/NP basis after Summer 2018 will not be accepted.

Overview
The major program is designed to provide integrative course experiences in the lower division and upper division, as well as the technical depth in computation and inference required for students to engage in data science upon graduation.
Data 100, Principles and Techniques of Data Science (CS/STAT C100), explores the data science lifecycle and focuses on quantitative critical thinking​ and key principles and techniques needed to carry out this cycle.  It bridges between Foundations of Data Science (Data 8) and upper division courses.
