The College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS) sponsors a Designated Emphasis in Computational and Data Science and Engineering (DE-CDSE), a program that is committed to the development of new curricula and expanded programs aimed at the development and propagation of the use of numerical and computational tools to further research across multiple disciplines.
The Designated Emphasis in Computational and Data Science and Engineering (DE-CDSE) Program at the University of California, Berkeley trains students to use and manage scientific data, whether it is in analyzing complex physical systems or in using statistics and machine learning, along with data visualization, to extract useful information from the massive amount of data that can be collected from sensors today. The CDSE program is committed to the development of new curricula and expanded programs aimed at development and propagation of the use of numerical and computational tools to further research across multiple disciplines. To that end, the CDSE program will actively support the training and multidisciplinary education of scientists, engineers and technical specialists who are experts in relevant areas.
The CDSE program crosses numerous disciplines. Participating departments include Computer Science, Mathematics, Chemistry, Mechanical Engineering, Astronomy, Neuroscience and Political Science, among many others. Upon graduation, the student receives a “PhD in X with a Designated Emphasis in Computational and Data Science and Engineering” on their transcript and diploma. This designation certifies that they participated in, and successfully completed, a Designated Emphasis in addition to the departmental requirements for the PhD, and completion of the DE-CDSE will also be posted to the student’s transcript.
