Emery N. Brown
Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Medical Engineering and Computational Neuroscience, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Warren M. Zapol Professor of Anesthesia, Harvard Medical School
Emery N. Brown is the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Medical Engineering and Computational Neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Warren M. Zapol Professor of Anesthesia at Harvard Medical School, and an anesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). He received a bachelor’s degree in applied mathematics from Harvard College, master’s and Ph.D. in statistics from Harvard University, and M.D. from Harvard Medical School. Brown is an anesthesiologist-statistician whose research is deﬁning the neuroscience of how anesthetics produce general anesthesia. He also develops statistical methods for neuroscience data analysis. His signal processing and statistical methods have been critical for accurately estimating the intrinsic period of the human circadian clock, decoding the dynamic representation of space maintained in the rat hippocampus and characterizing the neurophysiological signatures of different anesthetics. Brown is a fellow of IEEE, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the National Academy of Inventors. He is a member of the National Academy of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences, and National Academy of Engineering and the American Philosophical Society. Brown has received several awards, including NIH Director’s Pioneer Award, NIH Director’s Transformative Research Award, Guggenheim Fellowship in Applied Mathematics, the American Society of Anesthesiologists Excellence in Research Award, the Dickson Prize in Science, and the Swartz Prize for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience, .the Pierre M. Galletti Award, and the Gruber Prize in Neuroscience. Brown has received Doctor of Science honoris causa from USC and SUNY Downstate in New York.
