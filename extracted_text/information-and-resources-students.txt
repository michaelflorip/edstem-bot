CDSS Student Resources and Information
Established July 1, 2023, the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS) is the first new college at Berkeley in over 50 years. The College was created to meet the demands and opportunities at a time when data touches nearly every aspect of our lives. Innovations in computing and statistics are converging to create unprecedented opportunities to use data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to tackle pressing societal challenges from human health to climate change.
CDSS offers outstanding undergraduate programs in Computer Science, Data Science, and Statistics. Over 1,500 students graduated with a degree in these majors in Spring 2023, and one in four held a second major in another discipline. CDSS undergraduates study with faculty from a wide range of fields, where they gain the knowledge, skills, and experiences needed to succeed in today’s datafied world, interact with data ethically, and masterfully engage as informed leaders.
Berkeley offers a variety of opportunities for graduate students, including Master’s and PhD programs in computer science and statistics and programs with interdisciplinary designated emphases in data science.
