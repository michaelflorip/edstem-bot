Data Science Connector Courses
Current Connector Courses
Click to view courses this semester
Connector courses weave together core concepts and approaches from Data 8 with complementary ideas or areas. Along the way, students gain additional experience, broader insights, or deeper theoretical or computational foundations.
Offered by faculty across many departments and fields of study, connectors are optional but highly encouraged and are designed to be taken at the same time or after the Foundations course. They offer two or more units of course credit. Data 8 and connectors complement each other and often use similar materials or tools.
For connector courses being offered in the current/next semester, please view our current course offerings.
For current and future connector instructors who are interested in learning more about the technology and workflows behind the program, please visit the Connector Guide(link is external).

How Does History Count?
HIST 88
We will explore how historical data becomes historical evidence and how recent technological advances affect long-established practices, such as close attention to historical context and contingency. Will the advent of fast computing and big data make history “count” more or lead to unprecedented insights into the study of change over time?
How Does History Count? Exploring Japanese-American Internment through Digital Sources
HIST 88
On February 19, 1942, Executive Order 9066 authorized the detention of more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent, most of them American citizens living on the west coast. In this data science connector course, students will learn emerging digital methods for conducting historical research, which they will apply to the study of Japanese-American Internment.
How does History Count? Enumerating Nature: Data Science and Environmental History
HIST 88
In an era of environmental uncertainty, we must address a critical question – how did we get to this point? Historians have wontedly depicted the natural world as a muted figure with an elusive past. Deciphering nature’s complex legacy requires the employment of materials and methods outside of the traditional purview of historians. However, we are no longer bound by traditional historical evidence. Data Science facilitates us with innovative tools and methods to examine quantitative sources. In this connector course, we will explore how historical data becomes historical evidence and how recent technological advances affect long-established practices, such as close attention to historical context and contingency. Will the advent of fast computing and big data make history “count” more or lead to unprecedented insights into the study of change over time? During our weekly discussions, we will apply what we learn in lectures and labs to the analysis of selected historical sources and get an understanding of constructing historical datasets. We will also consider scholarly debates over quantitative evidence and historical argument.
Data and Ethics
INFO 88A
This course provides an introduction to critical and ethical issues surrounding data and society.
Crime and Punishment: Taking the Measure of the US Justice System
LEGAL ST 88
We will explore how data are used in the criminal justice system by exploring the debates surrounding mass incarceration and evaluating a number of different data sources that bear on police practices, incarceration, and criminal justice reform. Students will be required to think critically about the debates regarding criminal justice in the US and to work with various public data sets to assess the extent to which these data confirm or deny specific policy narratives. Building on skills from Foundations of Data Science, students will be required to use basic data management skills working in Python: data cleaning, aggregation, merging and appending data sets, collapsing variables, summarizing findings, and presenting data visualizations.
Race, Policing, and Data Science

The course introduces students to Web science with a focus on how the Web works, types of Web data, and how to generate effective visualizations for Web data (e.g., social networks). The course covers basic principles and tools for understanding and visualizing Web data. It focuses heavily on project work that aims to give students hands-on experience with handling Web data. Because Web science is interdisciplinary by nature, this course connects students to different disciplines such as social science, computer science, and information science. At the end of the course, students should be able to apply Web mining techniques on and draw insights from real world data.
Behind the Curtain in Economic Development
L&S 88
This class will give students hands on experience looking at how data is gathered for analysis and provide context for the use of data for studying applied issues in economic development. The background will be a set of policy questions from a field study in rural Kenya on child health and clean drinking water.
Rediscovering Texts as Data
L&S 88
Humanists have traditionally emphasized the ‘close reading’ of a text, where value is placed on the nuances of specific passages. The increasing amount of digital text being published and archived affords us an opportunity to read text differently—as data on a scale larger than ever before. This ‘distant reading’ approach (mediated through the computer) complements our ‘close reading’ by providing a broader context for interpretation previously inaccessible.
Crime and Punishment: Taking the Measure of the US Justice System
LEGALST 88
We will explore how data are used in the criminal justice system by exploring the debates surrounding mass incarceration and evaluating a number of different data sources that bear on police practices, incarceration, and criminal justice reform.
