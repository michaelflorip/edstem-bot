Prerequisites are shown within square brackets.
Lower Division (select one)
CIV ENG 11. Engineered Systems and Sustainability (3 units) [CHEM 1A, MATH 1A]
LD ARCH 12. Environmental Science for Sustainable Development (4 units)
Upper Division (select two)
ARCH 140. Energy and Environment (4 units)
CIV ENG 107. Climate Change Mitigation (3 units)
CIV ENG 110. Water Systems of the Future (3 units)
CIV ENG 111. Environmental Engineering (3 units)
CIV ENG 155. Transportation Systems Engineering (3 units)
