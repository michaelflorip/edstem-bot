The Cognition domain emphasis introduces students to fundamental scientific questions about how the human mind works. It gives them the opportunity to pursue one or more disciplinary approaches, including psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics, and to consider computational models of mind.
From the lists shown below, students will select one course from the lower-division, and two courses from the upper-division. The lower division course is a required element of the Domain Emphasis.
Courses in this domain emphasis are often restricted by major to enroll, and several have extensive prerequisites. It may be difficult to complete this emphasis given these restrictions. Students are advised to make appropriate alternate plans.
Prerequisites are shown within square brackets.
