Our Pathway to Becoming a College
Our Impact
Berkeley’s impact in computing, statistics, information, and data science research and education is transforming the field. The College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS) collaborates with partners across campus and beyond to develop inclusive educational pathways and innovative data-based solutions to real-world problems. We build connections between computing and data science and other fields of scientific and societal inquiry, explore cutting-edge impacts, and share results broadly with scientific and public audiences.
Imagine the Gateway at UC Berkeley
Students, faculty, and campus leadership talk about the importance of The Gateway, opening in 2025 to house Computing, Data Science, and Society. The Gateway will bring together ingenious minds from UC Berkeley’s disparate disciplines to create data-driven solutions to our world’s greatest problems. https://light.berkeley.edu/
