Departments and Programs
The College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS) at UC Berkeley brings together programs, schools, departments, and partners to create accessible and equitable educational opportunities and catalyze groundbreaking research that meets society's greatest challenges. We are reimagining inclusive collaboration to tackle the technical, scientific, social, and human dimensions of urgent challenges in health and biomedicine, climate and sustainability, and human welfare and social justice.
Center for Computational Biology
The Center for Computational Biology supports interdisciplinary research on the broad array of subjects that cover the interface between computation and biology and fosters graduate and undergraduate education in the field.
Computational Precision Health
The UCSF-UC Berkeley Joint Program in Computational Precision Health (CPH) is a new graduate training and research program that applies computation in real-world settings to improve the quality, efficiency, and equity of medicine and public health. CPH uses novel computational algorithms, tools, and infrastructure to formulate precision problems, develop precision solutions that adapt to time, place, and context, and deploy precision solutions more effectively.
Data Science Undergraduate Studies
Data Science Undergraduate Studies offers a diverse range of opportunities for undergraduates interested in exploring the rapidly growing field of data science. Designed in collaboration with faculty from across the university, the Data Science B.A. provides students with deep technical knowledge, expertise in how to apply that knowledge in a field of their choosing, and an understanding of the social and human contexts and ethical implications of how data are collected, analyzed, and used. This combination positions graduates to help inform and develop solutions to pressing challenges, including adapting industry to a new world of data, amplifying learning in education, and helping communities.
Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences
The Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) at UC Berkeley offers one of the strongest research and instructional programs in this field anywhere in the world. The department’s top-ranked programs attract stellar students and professors who pioneer the frontiers of computer science with broad impacts on society. The integration of electrical engineering and computer science forms the core, with strong interactions that extend into biological sciences, mechanical and civil engineering, physical sciences, chemistry, mathematics, and operations research.
Department of Statistics
The Department of Statistics is a community engaged in research and education in probability and statistics. In addition to developing fundamental theory and methodology, the department is actively involved in statistical problems that arise in diverse fields including molecular biology, geophysics, astronomy, biomedical research, neurophysiology, sociology, political science, education, demography, and the U.S. Census.
