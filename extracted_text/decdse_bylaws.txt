ARTICLE 1: Purpose
The Graduate Group in Computational Science and Engineering shall establish and administer a graduate program of instruction and research leading to the Designated Emphasis in Computational Science and Engineering. The Designated Emphasis is applicable to existing Ph.D. programs at the University of California at Berkeley.
The interdisciplinary and diverse nature of academic and research interests of the faculty participating in the Designated Emphasis (DE) provide the student with a broad scope of educational opportunities. The appointment of an Executive Committee to monitor the activities of the Computational Science and Engineering Graduate Group, as described in Article 3, assures rigorous training for all students pursuing the DE.
ARTICLE 2: Membership
Membership in the Graduate Group is open to faculty of affiliated Ph.D. programs who are actively engaged in teaching and research in appropriate sub-fields and who wish to join the Graduate Group. New members are considered for membership in the Graduate Group upon submission of a curriculum vitae to the Chair, listing their qualifications and stating reasons for seeking membership, and subject to approval by the Graduate Group’s Executive Committee. Proposed members are nominated to the Dean of the Graduate Division for appointment by the Executive Committee. Membership shall be reviewed periodically by the Executive Committee, at which time inactive members may be recommended to the Graduate Dean for removal from the membership list.
ARTICLE 3: Executive Committee
Election. The administrative leadership of the Graduate Group shall be vested in an Executive Committee consisting of five elected members, all of whom are members of the Academic Senate. Members of the Executive Committee will be elected from among the Graduate Group membership, following nominations made by the Nominating Committee.
To ensure interdisciplinarity, the committee membership shall consist of 1) one representative from the Division of Computer Science, 2) one representative from the Department of Mathematics, and 3) three representatives from other departments. Any faculty may nominate other faculty to these 3 slates of candidates (CS, Math, and other). All faculty get 5 votes (1 for the CS slate, 1 for the Math slate, and 3 for the other slate); the three faculty from the other slate getting the most votes shall be elected.
Nominations by any member of the Group will also be included in the slate of candidates submitted to the membership. Election of the Executive Committee is by mail ballot and shall be completed by at least 3 weeks before the end of the spring semester. Votes cast electronically via e-mail are acceptable. The term of office will be two years following selection. Election results shall be announced to the membership by mail. Newly elected members shall assume their duties on July 1. In the initial election following approval of the Group, the three members receiving the largest number of votes shall serve a two-year term, the others a one-year term. The existing Executive Committee shall fill interim vacancies in its membership by appointment.
Executive Committee Chair. The Executive Committee will choose and recommend one of its members to the Graduate Dean for appointment as Chair of the group. The Chair of the Executive Committee is the de facto Chair of the Graduate Group for the DE.
Responsibilities. The Executive Committee shall meet at least once every semester to discuss issues of concern to the Graduate Group. The principal responsibilities of the Executive Committee are:
To review faculty membership for the Graduate Group and maintain a list of active members to be annually reported to the Dean of the Graduate Division. This includes the nomination to the Graduate Dean of a tenured faculty member as Head Graduate Adviser for the DE.
To review affiliation of affiliated Ph.D. programs and make appropriate recommendations to the Dean of the Graduate Division.
To appoint the standing committees described in Article 5 below and other ad hoc committees as needed.
To conduct administrative and clerical matters related to the activities of the Graduate Group.
The Executive Director will be invited to attend Executive Committee Meetings as a non-voting member.
The Chair of the Graduate Group (and Executive Committee) shall represent the Graduate Group membership in official matters pertaining to the DE. The Chair of the Graduate Group and the Chairs of the affiliated Ph.D. programs shall meet at least annually to discuss administrative, instructional, and research resource needs. The CDSE Executive Director will attend the meetings to provide high-level executive advice and to help to secure funding and promote the CDSE program.
ARTICLE 4: Program Standards
Admissions
Admissions criteria for the DE will be devised by the Admissions Committee and approved by the Executive Committee as described in Article 5. Criteria will be clearly articulated to applicants (e.g., through the DE’s website).
Curriculum
The curriculum of the DE will consist of specified courses that may be independent from, or an integral part of, the doctoral programs with which it is associated. These will be determined by the Curriculum Committee as described in Article 5. The curricular requirements of the Ph.D. program and of the DE must be met before the student takes the qualifying examination. Any changes in curriculum requirements must be reported to the Graduate Division for review and approval.
Qualifying Examination
All students must be admitted to the DE program before the qualifying examination. The qualifying examination must include an examination of knowledge within the DE. At least one faculty member of the DE must participate in the qualifying examination, as determined by the DE Graduate Advising Committee or its designate, as described in Article 5, and in consultation with the Head Graduate Adviser in the affiliated Ph.D. program. Satisfactory performance on the qualifying examination for the Ph.D. will be judged according to the established rules in the affiliated program.
Dissertation
The dissertation topic shall incorporate study within the DE. The dissertation committee must include at least one faculty member of the DE, as recommended to the Head Graduate Adviser of the student’s home department or program by the DE Graduate Advising Committee or its designate, as described in Article 5, to ensure that the dissertation contributes in a significant way to the interdisciplinary field of the DE.
Degree Conferral
The DE will be acknowledged solely in conjunction with the Ph.D. in an established Ph.D. program and will be signified by the transcript and diploma designation “Ph.D. in Name of Student Major with a Designated Emphasis in Computational Science and Engineering.”
Program Evaluation
Evaluation of the academic quality of the DE will be conducted within the course of Graduate Council program review.
ARTICLE 5: Other Committees
The following four committees will be appointed by the Executive Committee and have the following responsibilities:
Admissions Committee
To establish student admissions criteria, to be approved by the Executive Committee, and review them for appropriate modifications.
To review, and recommend for approval to the Head Graduate Adviser, graduate student applications to the DE.
To collaborate with the affiliated Ph.D. programs in the recruitment of graduate students.
Curriculum Committee
To review course requirements for the DE and make appropriate additions and deletions to the list of relevant courses. Changes in curriculum requirements must be reported to the Graduate Division for review and approval before implementation.
To review Qualifying Examination and Dissertation requirements and make appropriate modifications. Requirement changes must be reported to the Graduate Division for review and approval before implementation.
Nominating Committee
To propose a slate of candidates for open positions on the Executive Committee in the annual election.
