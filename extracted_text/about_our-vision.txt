Our Vision
Computing, Data Science and Society at Berkeley
Image
Our lives and our society are being changed by computing, statistics, and data science: the platforms on which we innovate, communicate, transact, make decisions, and allocate resources. At Berkeley, we believe computing and data science are for everyone. We need diverse perspectives, experiences, and expertise to ensure research and applications represent the needs and interests of society.
The College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS) is the first new college at UC Berkeley in more than 50 years. Our vision is to:
Image
Educate all students to approach data ethically and masterfully
Image
Advance the state-of-the-art in the core of computing, data science, and statistics
Image
Found new fields bringing computing and data science together with other disciplines
Image
Make sustained progress on issues of human and societal significance
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Belonging, and Justice
Diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging, and justice are essential elements of educating a rising generation of students, building a collaborative presence across campus, and serving society.
Our Pathway to Becoming a College
Berkeley’s impact in computing and data science research and education is transforming the field. The College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS) collaborates with partners across campus and beyond to develop inclusive educational pathways and innovative data-based solutions to real-world problems.
