Three gifts of $25 million each will reinforce UC Berkeley’s position as a leader in computing and data science research and education, and help create a visionary new home for the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS).
Notably, two of the gifts are from current Berkeley faculty: professors Scott Shenker and Ion Stoica of the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society, and the College of Engineering.
“We are deeply grateful for these three gifts", said Jennifer Chayes, associate provost of the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society. “I cannot imagine a stronger endorsement of CDSS and of Berkeley than the unprecedented generosity of our two current faculty, Scott and Ion.”
