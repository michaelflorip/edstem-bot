Success Stories
A Discovery project used satellite imagery to bring real-time pest information to farmers in Africa, restructured data infrastructures to facilitate water quality monitoring systems for state regulators in California, and used computer vision to help UCSF doctors identify irregularities in x-ray images. And that’s just the beginning.
