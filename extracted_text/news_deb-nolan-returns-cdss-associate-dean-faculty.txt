Deb Nolan returns to CDSS as Associate Dean for Faculty
Deb Nolan
Deb Nolan, emeritus professor of statistics at UC Berkeley and former associate dean for undergraduate education at the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS), has returned to CDSS as Associate Dean for Faculty for the spring 2022 semester.
As Associate Dean for Faculty, Nolan provides leadership in facilitating faculty appointment and promotion cases for CDSS and works closely with CDSS Associate Provost Jennifer Chayes and department chairs. She joins the other CDSS associate deans: Charis Thompson, associate dean for campus partnerships; Catherine Ceniza Choy, associate dean of diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging, and justice; Armando Fox, associate dean of online programs; and John DeNero, associate dean of undergraduate studies.
Nolan’s work with CDSS goes back to the beginnings of the Data Science Undergraduate Studies program and the development of a data science major at Berkeley. She served on the faculty committee that designed the major in 2017, and developed and taught the Data 100 course: Principles and Techniques of Data Science, which helps to bridge Data 8 with upper division courses. She also served as associate dean for undergraduate education during the 2020-21 academic year. Nolan officially retired from Berkeley in June 2021 but continues to provide counsel and partner with CDSS on special projects including Career Accelerator, a new data science internship program.
