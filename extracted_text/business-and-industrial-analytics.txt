The Business and Industrial Analytics domain emphasis allows students to explore the principles and methods of making data-driven decisions under uncertainty in the worlds of business and industry. Students will learn how to approach management decisions from economic, probabilistic, and computational perspectives, and how to analyze and manage risk.
From the lists shown below, students will select one course from the lower-division, and two courses from the upper-division. The lower division course is a required element of the Domain Emphasis.
Courses in this domain emphasis are often restricted by major to enroll, and several have extensive prerequisites. It may be difficult to complete this emphasis given these restrictions. Students are advised to make appropriate alternate plans.
Prerequisites are shown within square brackets.
Lower Division (select one)
ECON 1. Introduction to Economics (4 units)*
ECON 2. Introduction to Economics (4 units)*
MATH 53. Multivariable Calculus (4 units)
*For students completing the lower-division requirement outside of UC Berkeley at a college where microeconomics and macroeconomics are offered as separate courses, only microeconomics is required for the Data Science BA. However, note that full equivalence to Econ 1 may still be required as a prerequisite to other courses you wish to take at UC Berkeley.
