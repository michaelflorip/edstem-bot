About CDSS
UC Berkeley's College of Computing, Data Science, and Society strives to develop, implement and share high-quality, ethics-oriented and accessible curricula, educating a diverse student body in data science, computing and statistics.
Faculty and students from across campus helped shape the vision and foundations for the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society, which mirrors the cross-cutting nature of data science and redefines the research university for the digital age.
We are meeting the challenges and opportunities presented by a world increasingly informed and shaped by data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in virtually every arena, from health to business to politics, from our cities to the climate and the cosmos.
The college’s dynamic structure connects computing, statistics, the humanities, and social and natural sciences to create a vibrant and collaborative environment that accelerates breakthrough research across scientific and technological frontiers.
Core to the college is an understanding of how computing and data science affect equality, equity, and opportunity—and the capacity to respond to social challenges.
To fully support data science in a broad, rich, and deep manner, the the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society connects the Center for Computational Biology, Computational Precision Health, Data Science Undergraduate Studies, and the departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences and Statistics.
To enhance synergy, the college includes Bakar Institute of Digital Materials for the Planet, Berkeley Institute for Data Science and D-Lab.
