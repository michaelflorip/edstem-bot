Meeting Schedule
The Data Science Degree Programs Governance Committee meets monthly during the academic year. The committee does not meet during Summer. Any requests for consideration should be submitted to the Director of Advising, Laura Imai (lauraimai@berkeley.edu and will be reviewed at the next scheduled meeting.
Proposal Guidelines
Submitting a Course for Review for the Major
Determine which requirement your course may be most appropriate to satisfy:
Review the Criteria for Courses Meeting Major Requirements.
For Domain Emphases, review the description of each Domain Emphasis and the list of currently approved courses on our website.
Evaluate whether the availability and the accessibility of the course make it appropriate to count for a Data Science major requirement.
Email a copy of the course syllabus to Laura Imai (lauraimai@berkeley.edu). The syllabus will be forwarded to the relevant subcommittee for review, and if appropriate, forwarded to the full Governance Committee.
Submitting a Course for Review for the Minor
To be approved as an elective for the Data Science minor, a course must meet at least one of the following criteria:
Course has a significant computational component, such as problem sets or labs in a programming or statistical language
Course applies data science within a specific subject domain (may overlap with Data 8 or Data 100 concepts in domain-specific applications)
Course has significant technical content or other substantive value that DIRECTLY RELATES to the practice of Data Science
Evaluate whether the availability and the accessibility of the course make it appropriate to count as a Data Science minor elective.
Email a copy of the course syllabus to Laura Imai (lauraimai@berkeley.edu). The syllabus will be forwarded to the minor subcommittee for review, and if appropriate, forwarded to the full Governance Committee.
