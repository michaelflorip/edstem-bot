Adrian Hill
Assistant Dean, Interdisciplinary Initiatives
College of Computing, Data Science, and Society
Adrian Hill is assistant dean for interdisciplinary initiatives in the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society. She joined CDSS with more than 15 years’ experience working to support academic research, most recently in the Office of the Executive Vice President for Research at Columbia University. In that role, she worked to bolster cross-campus research themes, including climate and precision medicine. She partnered with faculty leadership to develop the Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute and strengthen its ties with academic departments across the university. She has led strategic planning on behalf of deans and department chairs in science and engineering, and has supported interdisciplinary faculty teams submitting private and federal grant proposals. At Columbia, Adrian collaborated with university partners in Washington, DC to advocate for increased research funding to the academic community. She has a MPA from the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs, and a BA from Barnard College.
