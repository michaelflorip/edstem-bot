Aaron Streets
Faculty Advisor, Excellence and Equity
College of Computing, Data Science, and Society
Streets is associate professor in the Department of Bioengineering at UC Berkeley and a core member of the Biophysics Program and the Center for Computational Biology. As faculty advisor for diversity at CDSS, Streets will develop and lead initiatives to enhance diversity in STEM higher education, including mentoring and professional development programs for graduate students and postdocs aimed at increasing the diversity and quality of faculty search pools. He partners with the CDSS Assistant Dean for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Belonging, and Justice (DEIBJ) to develop initiatives as part of CDSS’s broader vision and activities in DEIBJ. Streets co-founded the Next Generation Faculty Symposium, a program that provides mentorship to junior scientists and seeks to increase the diversity and quality of faculty applicant pools in the quantitative biological and biomedical sciences at UC Berkeley, Stanford University, and UCSF.
Streets’ research draws on mathematics, physics, and engineering to develop novel tools for precision measurement of biological systems. In collaboration with Berkeley’s Nir Yosef, the Streets lab created totalVI (Total Variational Inference), a computer algorithm that uses deep learning to integrate gene datasets and protein datasets from single cells. totalVI provides a system for managing and analyzing complex data, enabling large-scale collaborative research initiatives like the Human Cell Atlas. He is also working on technology that maps protein-DNA interactions with single molecule resolution to help researchers understand how cells read their genome, especially in regions that have been difficult to study.
He completed bachelor’s degrees in art and physics from UCLA, and earned a Ph.D. in applied physics from Stanford University. A Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Investigator and a Pew Biomedical Scholar, Streets has received honors including the CZI Science Diversity Leadership Award, the Popular Science's Brilliant 10, the UC Bioengineering Systemwide Shu Chien Early Career Award, and the National Science Foundation's CAREER Award.
