About the Program
The Data Scholars Program provides spaces where students from many disciplines and backgrounds learn together, develop their data science skills, and co-create a diverse community.  Students receive mentorship, support in introductory data science classes, and guidance to advance in the field through academic support, research opportunities, professional development, and community with other Scholars.
Data Scholars hold many different identities and come from many different backgrounds that are often minoritized in the field, including but not limited to low income, first generation college, transfer, re-entry, undocumented, historically underrepresented ethnicity or gender, disabled, foster, and LGBTQIA+.
Program Components
Foundations supports Scholars enrolled in Data 8, by providing the close-knit atmosphere of a small class within the large Data 8 class. The program augments Data 8 with a weekly workshop, dedicated office hours, and advising.
Academic Development connects Scholars with regular expert support in lower division math and CS classes required for the Data Science major and minor, as well as in Data 100.
Discovery provides individual research mentoring as well as a community of peer researchers for Scholars in the Data Science Discovery Program
Career Development is dedicated to Scholars who have completed Data 100 and wish to explore opportunities in industry. In collaboration with Career Accelerator, the program provides Scholars with guidance in professional development and identifying internship opportunities.
Speaker Series consists of talks by alums, CDSS members, and data science professionals, giving Scholars the opportunity to connect with people who have careers in the field.
