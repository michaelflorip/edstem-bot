Berkeley Data Stack
The Berkeley Data Stack is a collection of open source tools that help enable large-scale data science research and education efforts across UC Berkeley, including Jupyter Interactive computing notebooks, textbooks, and autograding tools.
Data Peer Consulting
Students help peers on everything from using Jupyter notebooks to learning SQL on an appointment and drop-in basis.
Data Science Education Workshops
Resources from our pedagogy workshops, including the academic resource kit, are available to support instructors in learning and incorporating data science approaches and teaching tools.
Data Scholars
Data Scholars addresses issues of underrepresentation in the data science community by establishing a community that is welcoming, educational, and empowering for underrepresented and nontraditional students.
Student Opportunities
Students are the heart of our program, helping to create new data science content and courses, support outreach and communications, and advance research.
Textbooks
Berkeley's core data science classes use interactive online textbooks that are available to all.
Datahub
Berkeley Datahub refers to the campus infrastructure set up on datahub.berkeley.edu. Datahub is a tool that allows Berkeley’s data science program to utilize cloud computing infrastructure to deploy scalable resources that enable users to interact remotely with a standardized, common computing environment.
Application Hub - Undergraduate Student Opportunities
The Data Science Undergraduate Studies student teams' applications for Spring 2023 are now closed! Please check back next semester for more student team opportunities. Please contact ds-teams@berkeley.edu  if you have any questions or concerns.
