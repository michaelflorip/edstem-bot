Data Science Major (B.A.)
Designed in collaboration with faculty from across Berkeley, Data Science invests students with deep technical knowledge, expertise in how to apply that knowledge in a field of their choosing, and an understanding of the social and human contexts and ethical implications of how data are collected, analyzed, and used.
Statistics Major (B.A.)
Statistics equips students with quantitative skills to employ and build on in flexible ways, including an understanding of probability theory, statistical reasoning and inferential methods, statistical computing, statistical modeling, and description, interpretation, and exploratory analysis of data.
Undergraduate Minors
