Workshops
This page contains a collection of resources for professors to use in adopting data science curricula at their own institutions. These resources have been prepared through a collaborative effort with the Data Science Education Program (DSEP) and the professors of the Department of Statistics, Computer Science, faculty in Human Contexts and Ethics, and more.
Several of the institutions we have worked with in the past are listed on our partner institutions page.
Data 8 Adoption
