Computational Methods in Molecular and Genomic Biology
This domain emphasis will prepare students for work or graduate school in bioinformatics and computational biology with a focus on molecular biology and genomics. Students with this emphasis will be able to understand how computational and statistical methods are used to elucidate the mechanisms of cellular processing of genetic data and will prepare them for computational analyses of DNA sequencing data and other molecular biological data.
From the lists shown below, students will select one course from the lower-division, and two courses from the upper-division. The lower division course is a required element of the Domain Emphasis.
Courses in this domain emphasis are often restricted by major to enroll, and several have extensive prerequisites. It may be difficult to complete this emphasis given these restrictions. Students are advised to make appropriate alternate plans.
Prerequisites are shown within square brackets.
Lower Division (select one)
BIOLOGY 1A. General Biology Lecture (3 units) [Prerequisite: CHEM 1A; Co-requisite: BIOLOGY 1AL]
BIOLOGY 1B. General Biology Lecture and Laboratory (4 units)
