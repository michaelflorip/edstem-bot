Linguistic Sciences
The domain emphasis in Linguistic Sciences explores the data-driven analysis of language. Topics include linguistic structure (phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax), logic and the philosophy of language, natural language processing, and empirical approaches to reasoning about language as data.
From the lists shown below, students will select one course from the lower-division, and two courses from the upper-division.
Prerequisites are shown within square brackets.
Lower Division (select one)
PHILOS 12A. Introduction to Logic (4 units)
**LINGUIS 100. Introduction to Linguistic Science (4 units)
Upper Division (select two)
**LINGUIS 100. Introduction to Linguistic Science (4 units)
LINGUIS 108. Psycholinguistics (4 units) [LINGUIS 100]
LINGUIS 110. Phonetics (4 units) [LINGUIS 100]
LINGUIS 111. Phonology (4 units) [LINGUIS 100]
LINGUIS 113. Experimental Phonetics (4 units) [LINGUIS 110]
LINGUIS 115. Morphology (4 units) [LINGUIS 100]
LINGUIS 120. Syntax (4 units) [LINGUIS 100]
LINGUIS 121. Logical Semantics (4 units) [LINGUIS 120]
LINGUIS/COG SCI C142. Language and Thought (3 units)
LINGUIS C160/COG SCI C140. Quantitative Methods in Linguistics (4 units) [COG SCI C100]
LINGUIS 188. Linguistic Data (3 units)
INFO 159. Natural Language Processing (4 units) [COMPSCI 61B, COMPSCI 70 or Data 100]
PHILOS 133. Philosophy of Language (4 units) [PHILOS 12A]
**Linguistics 100 may count toward the lower-division or upper-division requirement, but not both. Students may fulfill this domain emphasis by completing LINGUIS 100 plus two additional upper-division courses from the list, without taking a lower-division course. Please note that there are a limited number of courses approved for this domain emphasis that can be taken without LINGUIS 100 as a prerequisite.
