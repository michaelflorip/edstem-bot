Philosophical Foundations: Evidence and Inference
When do data confirm a hypothesis or a theory? What do we do when several different hypotheses or theories are consistent with the data? When, if ever, is inductive inference justified? How are models related to what they model? When is reasoning good reasoning? Which conclusions can be inferred from which premises? How does it depend on what we are reasoning about: arithmetic, the physical world, what exists, what is possible, what is known? What are we saying when we say that something is likely or unlikely to occur? What are we saying when we say that one event caused another? Are we saying something about the world or merely something about us, about what we have observed and what we now expect?
