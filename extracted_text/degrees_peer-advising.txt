Peer Advising Drop-in Advising Hours (Hybrid)
Mon-Thu 10am-4pm
Peer Advising is available from Weeks 2 through 14 each term. Peer Advising is not available in the summer.
Peer Advising is hybrid. When you sign in, you will be able to request your advising session either online via Zoom/Google Meet or in-person at 130 Warren Hall (back entrance).
Sign In
to join the waiting list during drop-in hours. This link is only active during drop-in hours as listed in the schedule above.
View Queue
to check your position in the queue after you have signed in.
When your name reaches the top of the list:
If you selected an in-person session, make sure you are at 130 Warren Hall before joining queue.
If you selected an online session, check your UC Berkeley email account for an email from a Data Science Peer Advisor with a link to join your online Google Meet session. Depending on the number of advisors available, this email may take 10-15 minutes to arrive. Join your Google Meet session within 5 minutes of receiving the email.
You will not be able to sign in if drop-in hours have not started or have already ended. Sign-ins may end early if the waiting list is already too long for peer advisors to see all waiting students.
Data Science Peer Advisors (DSPAs) complement the Data Science Advising services by sharing their diverse knowledge and experiences with DS courses, different Data Science Major domain emphases, extracurriculars, and student groups on campus, research opportunities, and various campus resources.
SPRING 2024: DSPAs are available for drop-in advising beginning in week two of the semester.  Their last advising day for the Spring 2024 semester will be Thursday, April 25th.

Hi everyone! My name is Asbah, and I am a junior studying Data Science and Cognitive Science, and I am also pursuing the Berkeley Certificate in Design Innovation. I was first exposed to the Data Science field when I took Data 8 in my first semester at Cal. Data 8 opened my eyes to the numerous applications of Data Science to almost any other field, which spurred my interest in the subject even further. Cognitive Science is also an interdisciplinary field, and I find it fascinating how both subjects go hand-in-hand. This encouraged me to become more involved in organizations at Cal, such as DSUS, to share my passion with my peers. I have previously been Connector Associate for a Data Science connector course, and I have also been on course staff for Data 100. In my free time, I enjoy drawing, painting, reading, going on walks, and organizing. Feel free to drop in to my advising hours if you would like some advice, guidance, or just want to chat! As a DSPA, I hope to share my knowledge, passion, and experiences to better support you!

Hi! My name is Lori, and I’m a senior double majoring in Data Science and Business. I didn’t have much coding experience before coming to Berkeley, but I really enjoyed statistics so I decided to take Data 8 my first semester. After taking Data 8, I wanted to learn how to apply data science to other industries, especially for environmental good and business challenges. I also love to travel, and I studied abroad in Madrid during my junior spring semester. In my free time, I like to play basketball, hike, watch movies, and spend time with my friends! If you have any questions or just want to chat, please feel free to come to my advising hours. :)

Hi! I'm Michael and I'm a second-year Data Science major. My favorite thing about data science is how applicable it is to every field of interest and work. For me, DATA 100 was the deciding factor in my decision to be a Data Science major. On campus, I'm a member of Data Science Society at Berkeley, where I've been a member for three semesters. I was a consultant in the Social Good Committee in my previous two semesters and I’m currently the Vice President of Sourcing. I’m responsible for finding and signing on clients for both the Social Good and Consulting committees, as well as managing client relations. I’m also a UCS1 (Tutor) for DATA C8. In my free time, I enjoy watching NBA basketball and trying new foods. I love talking about my experiences and past involvements so come by advising hours and I'm happy to chat!

As a freshman, I never imagined that I would study Data Science, but my DS classes had super welcoming communities and supportive staff! I hope to help other students see how accessible Data Science is. In my free time, you can find me catching up on Netflix shows (always looking for recs), reading, or finding the best food spots with friends. Please feel free to reach out if you need second opinions, class advice, or have any Data Science related questions!
