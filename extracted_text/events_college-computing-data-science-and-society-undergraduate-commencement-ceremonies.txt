College of Computing, Data Science, and Society Undergraduate Commencement Ceremonies
Thursday, May 16, 2024
Hearst Greek Theatre
2:00 pm Pacific Time
7:00 pm Pacific Time
We have heard student concerns and requests for additional guest tickets so that graduates can celebrate with family and friends. In order to accommodate these requests, CDSS will be holding two commencement ceremonies at the Greek Theatre on May 16.
Graduating students will be allotted 6 tickets for their guests. We are working with Cal Performances to determine ticket sales, and will continue updating graduating students via email from Marching Order with additional information as it becomes available.
