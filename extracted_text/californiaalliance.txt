Timeline
The California Alliance for Data Science Education (CADSE) seeks to advance data science education in California Community Colleges (CCCs), California State Universities, and the University of California system. We provide services including:
Providing computing resources for community colleges such as JupyterHub
Building community college transfer pathways for data science programs in the CSU and UC system.
Training for Instructors and course content support
Community gatherings and thought leadership
Support grants and fundraising efforts
CADSE was created to meet the urgent need to expand access, diversify participation, and support data science teaching across higher education institutions in the state of California. This sector will be fundamental to the health of the state’s economy, and a well-trained workforce will be a basis for jobs in Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and across the innovation ecosystem.
“Increasing access to data science as a career option for all students is key to making data science a more diverse and inclusive field. We welcome partnership with members of the California Alliance for Data Science Education in sharing resources and curriculum and supporting data science teaching across the state.”
Jennifer Chayes
—Dean, College of Computing, Data Science, and Society, UC Berkeley
