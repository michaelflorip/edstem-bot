Student Researchers
The majority of students participate in Discovery as Student Researchers. They can apply to projects of their interest and work in teams throughout the semester on a research or social impact project under the guidance of a project mentor. Student Researchers earn academic units as they complete their project with their team, but they do not enroll in a formally scheduled class.
Research Partners
Discovery is dedicated to providing top-notch data science capacity to our project partners while also fostering a unique learning environment for our students. Project partners should design projects so that a team of students can be engaged over the course of a single or multiple semesters (a semester is about 12 weeks of work). Projects should include a strong data component, and a dataset must be available by the start of the semester. Project partners can submit multiple projects.
Spring 2024 Student Applications is now closed.

Fall 2024 Partner Application will open in March, 2024.
