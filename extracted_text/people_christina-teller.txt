Christina Teller
Executive Director of Academic Programs
Data Science Undergraduate Studies
Christina Teller joins the college from UC Berkeley's Office of Undergraduate Advising within the College of Letters and Science (L&S), where she was an Assistant Director. While in that role, she served as a catalyst for change, leading the process of significant organizational change that culminated with the launch of a new model of advising for L&S. Christina advocated for and led the process for creating a culture of assessment, advancing strategic decision making rooted in data.
Before returning to UC Berkeley, Christina spent six years at the University of San Francisco and oversaw several master’s programs, working closely with faculty and administration. She is a Bay Area native and graduated from UCLA with a degree in Psychology, completed her M.A. in Education at UC Berkeley, and earned an Ed.D. in Organization and Leadership from the University of San Francisco.
Using a Critical Race Theory framework, Christina's dissertation research focused on issues of access and equity for traditionally underrepresented students in higher education. Her dissertation is titled, "Resilience and Resistance: How First-Generation College Students Leverage Community Cultural Wealth and Social Capital to Successfully Transfer from a Community College to a Selective Four-year Institution."
