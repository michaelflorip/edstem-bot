Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Belonging, and Justice (DEIBJ)
The College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS) is making data science and computing inviting, engaging, and respectful for people of diverse identities, backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. Diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging, and justice are essential to education and to serving society as a whole.
Computing and data science raise fundamental issues of justice and participation. As scientists and analysts, and as those benefiting from and affected by the products and uses of data, work in this field is deeply engaged with, and has profound implications for, the wellbeing of human beings and our world. In everything the college does, we are shaping this new field to be equitable and inclusive.
In education, CDSS strives to create inclusive curricula, collaborate with a diverse group of faculty and students, create a welcoming community that expands opportunity from all areas of campus, and create a pipeline of programs (such as Data Scholars and Berkeley Unboxing Data Science) to introduce K-12 students to data science. In research and service, the college seeks to work with partners and serve populations that may have been left out of data science in the past. We aim to reach the widest possible set of stakeholders. It is our belief that in engaging broadly, the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society can do justice to the full diversity of the Berkeley campus and our larger society, and have a positive impact on the world.
