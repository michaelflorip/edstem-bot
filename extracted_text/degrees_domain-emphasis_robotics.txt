Robotics
The goal of the domain emphasis in Robotics is to provide a pathway into the field of robotics, which includes the design and control of robots as well as the study of relationships between robots and nature. Topics include manipulation and control, decision making grounded in the physical world, embedded systems, mechatronics, and human-robot interaction.
From the lists shown below, students will select one course from the lower-division, and two courses from the upper-division. The lower division course is a required element of the Domain Emphasis.
Courses in this domain emphasis are often restricted by major to enroll, and several have extensive prerequisites. It may be difficult to complete this emphasis given these restrictions. Students are advised to make appropriate alternate plans.
Prerequisites are shown within square brackets.
Lower Division (select one)
MATH 53. Multivariable Calculus (4 units) [Prerequisite: MATH 1B]
Upper Division (select two)
BIO ENG 105. Engineering Devices 1 (4 units) [Prerequisites: MATH 53, PHYS 7A+7B]
BIO ENG / EECS C106A. Introduction to Robotics (4 units) [Prerequisites: EECS 16A + 16B or Math 54; CS 61A; CS 61B preferred]
BIO ENG / EECS C106B. Robotic Manipulation and Interaction (4 units) [Prerequisite: BIO ENG/EECS C106A]
EECS 149. Introduction to Embedded Systems (4 units) [Prerequisites: CS 61C, CS 70, EE 16A+16B]
EL ENG 192. Mechatronic Design Laboratory (4 units) [Prerequisites: EE 16A+16B, CS 61ABC, EE 120]
INTEGBI C135L. The Mechanics of Organisms (4 units) [Prerequisites: intro physics & biology]
MEC ENG 119. Introduction to MEMS (Microelectromechanical Systems) (3 units) [Prerequisites: PHYSICS 7B, MEC ENG 100]
MEC ENG C134 / EL ENG C128. Feedback Control Systems (4 units) [Prerequisites: EECS 16A or MEC ENG 100, MEC ENG 132 or EE 120]
MEC ENG 135. Design of Microprocessor-Based Mechanical Systems (4 units) [Prerequisite: ENGIN 7]
These course lists are subject to change.
